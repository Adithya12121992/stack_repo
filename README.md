3. Collaboration

For the implementation of this assignment we have met in person 4 times, for the prioritizer architecture, implementation ,testing and code merge.<br/>
Apart from the in person meetings we did discuss about the assignment through slack as a collaboration medium and also had multiple standup meetings over phone call.<br/>

4. How to?

The execution of this prioritizer begins with the Main.java, after this the user will be prompted to enter the type of Prioritizer.<br/>
Upon selection of the prioritizer, user will be prompted to enter the Prioritizer size and the operation they would require to do.<br/>

Note: The entire Git and versioning process was handled by one person only(hence, you can see only git commits from Adithya in the github repo).<br/>
Note: The entire code was developed using IntelliJ IDE.<br/>
